I mainly want to learn about web spider using Python.But, nothing to crawl.Anyway, the 1024 website is a good example.



#  Installation
    1024Spider is depended on Pysipder.
    Pyspider: https://github.com/binux/pyspider

    You can install Pyspider firstly and then create a project on WebUI. Copy  my code into it.

    If you need more infomation, please read the Pyspider docment.
